hello my brother, i am a muslim and i was born in a muslim family, i was looking at youtube shorts and happened on your video, i hope you wont mind if i give my two cents, first of all let me summarize, your question is why are so many christians or "so called chritians" as you put it renouncing their faith and converting to islam, and you also added that there are more male converts than females?, then your two possible reasons are 1) is it beacause the ones converting to islam were never truly christians to begin with, and 2) is it because of the brotherhood associated with islam

lets look at your second reasoning first, by brotherhood and you mentioning that there are more male converts than females if you are implying that islam cares about converting more males than females than its not true, in islam the message is for all of humanity, men and women, whether you are a christian or jew or atheist etc, in islam or in any religion in general brotherhood refers to unity of the members of that faith, an alliance, it doesn't matter if you are a male or a female, but as a christian you probably already knew that, in islam the muslims are in general considered to be brothers and sisters and if i am not mistaken the same is true for christianity, there are some exceptions obviously, prophet adam and his wife, as they are considered to be the parents of all of mankind in islam, a very plausible argument to why you see more male converts than females on social media and youtube would be that islam commands both men and women to maintain hijab, so most likely the female converts don't display themselves in public too often, causing biases.

then coming to your first reasoning, is the reason for conversion that the ones converting were weak in faith to christianity?, perhaps or perhaps not, it is possible and most likely the case that they looked at the core principles of islam and the theology, agreed with it then accepted it, and so they are converting.

hope that helps.
